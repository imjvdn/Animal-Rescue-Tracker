# Animal Rescue Tracker - Project Plan

## Development Approach
This project will follow an iterative development approach with a structured Git workflow. We'll implement features incrementally, ensuring each component is properly tested before integration.

## Git Workflow
We'll follow a structured Git workflow with the following branches:
- **main**: Production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch for feature development
- **feature/[feature-name]**: Individual feature branches

Each feature will be developed in its own branch, tested, and then merged into develop. Once all features are complete and tested, develop will be merged into main.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Documentation
- Initialize Git repository
- Create project documentation
- Set up branch structure

### Phase 2: Monkey Class Implementation
- Create Monkey.java class
- Implement inheritance from RescueAnimal
- Add monkey-specific attributes
- Implement constructor
- Create accessors and mutators
- Add input validation for species

### Phase 3: Driver Class Modifications
- Implement menu loop with input validation
- Complete intakeNewDog() method
- Add monkeyList ArrayList
- Implement intakeNewMonkey() method
- Implement reserveAnimal() method
- Implement printAnimals() method

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement
- Test all functionality
- Refine user interface
- Add additional validation
- Ensure code quality and documentation

## Implementation Timeline

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| Project Setup | Complete |
| Documentation | Complete |
| Monkey Class | Not Started |
| Driver Class Menu Loop | Not Started |
| intakeNewDog() Method | Not Started |
| intakeNewMonkey() Method | Not Started |
| reserveAnimal() Method | Not Started |
| printAnimals() Method | Not Started |
| Testing | Not Started |
| Final Review | Not Started |

## Testing Strategy
Each component will be tested individually before integration:
- Monkey class will be tested for proper inheritance and attribute management
- Driver class methods will be tested for proper functionality and input validation
- The complete system will be tested for integration and user experience

## Coding Standards
All code will follow these standards:
- Proper Java naming conventions
- Comprehensive documentation with JavaDoc comments
- Consistent indentation and formatting
- Appropriate error handling and input validation
