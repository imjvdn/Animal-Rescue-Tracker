- Track animals through various training phases
- Manage animal reservations for service
- Maintain detailed records of each animal's attributes and status

## System Features
- Intake new animals (dogs and monkeys)
- Reserve animals for service
- Generate reports of animals by type and status
- Track training progress through various phases
